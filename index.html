                    Hi, I am Prabaljot Singh. I am a Web developer. I started my journey around November 2020 when I was
                    in 5th class. It was festival of diwali. I wanted to send my friends an image of happy diwali. I
                    searched on Internet and got image. A thought stuck in my mind that, I vists websites for my need.
                    Why don't I make a website of my own. I asked my father about it as he is a computer expert. He told
                    me that a website is created in computer language and you have to learn it in order to make a
                    website. Fortunately in my computer book of school, I had already heard about it. I done research on
                    internet related to it. Started learning online at internet how to make a website. When I learned
                    basics, my father enrolled me in a course at HIMT Institute Tanda nearby. Due to COVID-19 I had
                    enough time and attended online class. I learned HTML and CSS in 2 months. I took short course as it
                    was exams in 2 months. When exams were finished, I decided to learn myself on internet instead of
                    attending online classes as I was now in 6th and had to study more as now I was in middle school
                    from primary. I couldn't leave my studied also. So whenever I had free time I learned coding at
                    youtube. I learned Javascript, created many awesome projects, also learned Python as I wanted to
                    learn Django, learned advanced things in windows explored many softwares that reduced my work and
                    learned most important thing 'Git' and also created a youtube channel. Till now I was in 7th. I
                    created a website for my class.This was my first website that I deployed. Currently I am learning
                    Django and started ReactJS side by side.I have created this website on 14th April 2022.
