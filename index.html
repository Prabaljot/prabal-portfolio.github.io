                        <summary>Hi, I am Prabaljot Singh. I am a Web developer. I started my journey around November
                            2020
                            when I was
                            in 5th class. It was festival of diwali. I wanted to send my friends an image of happy
                            diwali. I
                            searched on Internet and got image. A thought stuck in my mind that, I vists websites for my
                            need.
                            Why don't I make a website of my own. I asked my father about it as he is a computer expert.
                            He
                            told
                            me that a website is created in computer language and you have to learn it in order to make
                            a
                            website. Fortunately in my computer book of school, I had already heard about it. I done
                            <i>
                                <font size="6">
                                    <b>Click to read more/less</b>
                                </font>
                            </i>

                        </summary>
                        research on
                        internet related to it. Started learning online at internet how to make a website. When I
                        learned
                        basics, my father enrolled me in a course at HIMT Institute Tanda nearby. Due to COVID-19 I had
                        enough time and attended online class. I learned HTML and CSS in 2 months. I took short course
                        as it
                        was exams in 2 months. When exams were finished, I decided to learn myself on internet instead
                        of
                        attending online classes as I was now in 6th and had to study more as now I was in middle school
                        from primary. I couldn't leave my studied also. So whenever I had free time I learned coding at
                        youtube. I learned Javascript, created many awesome projects, also learned Python as I wanted to
                        learn Django, learned advanced things in windows explored many softwares that reduced my work
                        and
                        learned most important thing 'Git' and also created a youtube channel. Till now I was in 7th. I
                        created a website for my class.This was my first website that I deployed. Currently I am
                        learning
                        Django and started ReactJS side by side.I have created this website on 14th April 2022.
